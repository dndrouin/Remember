# Remember
Tired of flying back to *Stranglethorn Vale* from *Stormwind City* just to realize you got so caught up in looking at the Auction House that you totally forgot to train your abilities for the 6th level in a row? Add a reminder for it, and **Remember** will make sure you remember it when you enter a capital city!

## About
**Remember** is a simple World of Warcraft addon written entirely in Lua. You add reminders to it while you're out in Azeroth, and when you get to a capital city, it presents them all to you. That's the whole addon. **Remember** is manipulated using slash-commands in chat, but displays information in a UI frame that can be moved anywhere on your screen.

 **Available Commands:**
 - `/remember add buy avocado toast` Adds a reminder to buy avocado toast.
 - `/remember remove buy a house` Removes a reminder to buy a house.
 - `/remember hide` Hides the main window.
 - `/remember show` Shows the main window.
 - `/remember help` Lists these commands and how to use them.

## Current Features <sup>(accurate as of October 21st, 2019)</sup>
- Custom reminders can be *only added* using slash commands in in-game chat. <sup>Unfortunately, the UI overhaul broke removing them so it's temporarily commented out. </sup>
- Outside of cities, the minimized window will be shown letting you know how many reminders you've created.
- When you enter a city, it switches to the maximized window allowing you to see your full list of reminders.
- You can also maximize and minimize the window whenever by clicking the arrow in the corner.
- Right click a listed reminder to mark it as completed.

## Future Features
Definitely happening:
- Saving reminders per character so /reload and logging out doesn't delete them
- Fixing the removal of reminders
- Left clicking reminders to delete them
- Less reliance on slash commands, more reliance on UI components
- Adding an options button on the top bar
